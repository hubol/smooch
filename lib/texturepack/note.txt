"Forked" from https://github.com/devrandom52/texturepack
Found ^that project by searching dependents of https://www.npmjs.com/package/maxrects-packer, a texture atlas packer that supports multiple texture atlas outputs.
It was hard to find projects that supported multiple atlas outputs.
Unfortunately, maxrects-packer does not have a CLI, and also did not have utilities for adding directories of images.
So I wanted to use someone else's work for that part.
texturepack is pretty good, but it actually prevents saving multiple outputs, hah!
It also doesn't support deep imports. Addressed with glob...
So this crude "fork" adjusts the appropriate components.
